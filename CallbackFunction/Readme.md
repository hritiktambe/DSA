# Callback Function

* A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function
* There are two types of callback
    * Synchronus which are executed immediately
        * which means they can be executed before the function that they are argument in or
          during the execution of function.
    * Asynchronus which are executed later
        * This means they are executed once the function returns
* Commonly used in event driven system
    - For eg when you click a button on keyboard
* In C it is implemented using function pointer
